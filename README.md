# Fuel Tracker

Fuel tracker is a lightweight web app tracking fuel consumption over time. It is designed to reduce the overhead of keeping spreadsheets of re-fuelling stops and finding time to input data collected from reciepts etc.

The front end is pulled together with bootstrap to handle the scaling of the website between desktop and mobile use. This is important as the primary time to register a re-fuelling event is straight away, in the car before leaving the forecourt.
